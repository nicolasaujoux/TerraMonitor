All the libraries necessary to compile the project are in the lib folder.
Here is a list of the libraries and a link to their project.
* DS1307RTC : in the Time library
* SHT10 humidity and temperature sensor
  : https://github.com/Trefex/arduino-airquality . This one seems to work better
  than the official.
* LCD i2c screen : http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/I2C/TWI_LCD1602_Module_(Gadgeteer_Compatible)_(SKU:_DFR0063).
